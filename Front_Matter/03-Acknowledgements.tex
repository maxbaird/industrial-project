I would like to thank my supervisor, Alex MacLaren, for her friendly guidance, useful insights, and enthusiasm throughout this endeavour.
I am also exceptionally grateful to Darren Quigley, Paddy Conaghan, Britta Kalkreuter, Martin Howe and Mark Wallace for the time they gave up to speak with me and share their insights into my research study.
Thank you to David Kelly and Amna Malik for testing my questionnaire, and to the forty AEC professionals who took time out of their busy schedules to complete my survey.
I am also much obliged to Les Copeland, who provided me with copies of the latest ACE Schedule of Services MEP editions through Paddy Conaghan.
And lastly, I would like to thank Max Baird for his unfaltering support.
