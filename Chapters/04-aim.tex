The aim of this research study is to investigate the discrepancies between industry guidance and practice in building services engineers' processes for collaboration in the UK.
% building services engineers' prescribed processes for communication and collaboration with other stakeholders during Stage 4 of RIBA PoW 2013, and compare the prescribed processes with reality.
To provide context before the discrepancies are sought, the concept of collaboration will be explored, along with the collaboration-enabling tools on the market for building services engineers.
The following objectives will cumulatively achieve this aim:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explore the meaning and implications of collaboration in the context of a design project and specifically regarding building services engineers.
    
    \item Identify the market-leading tools, used by building services engineers, that facilitate communication and collaboration, and briefly review the tools' interoperability.
    
    \item Examine the industry's authoritative documents that provide guidance for building services engineers regarding collaboration and their work processes.
    
    \item Assess the actual communication and collaboration processes of practising building services engineers.
    
    \item Conduct a comparative study of industry guidance and practice in building services engineers' processes for collaboration.
\end{enumerate}
